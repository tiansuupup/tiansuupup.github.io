                    What exactly causes players to be so engrossed in a game that they forget to eat, drink, and sleep? Jenova Chen (陈星汉) a prominent figure known for his work 'Journey,' once published a paper named "Flow In Game" when he was a student at the University of Southern California. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The paper concludes that: There are three essential elements for an immersive experience: the game must have a rewarding nature, it should provide challenges that match the player's abilities, and the player should have a sense of control over the characters in the game. As a result, the game leads players to lose a sense of time and self-awareness.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In a game, giving a character an item, upgrade an equipment, add a few points, is a simple way to give the player positive feedback so that the player feels a sense of control over the character. The difficulty is about how much feedback to give. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, based on the initial image, the X-axis represents the player's strength, where moving to the right indicates the player becoming stronger. The Y-axis represents the game difficulty, with an upward direction indicating higher difficulty. If the player's strength surpasses the game difficulty by too much, they might become bored at that moment. On the other hand, if the game is too difficult, the player may feel anxious. Only when the game intensity and player strength are in a certain proportion is it considered a state of concentration.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Let's think together about conventional game difficulty systems. In many games, you are actually asked to choose the difficulty level right at the beginning, ranging from easy, normal, to hard. But looking at it from today's perspective, it seems quite absurd. I've just bought a game, haven't played it yet, how do I know how well I'll perform?
                </p>
                    Some games go even further; they label their difficulty levels. For instance, they might say if you have previous FPS experience, you should choose the normal difficulty. If you think your skills are not up to par, then go for easy difficulty. 
                <p>
                    Now, this brings up a new issue. People have their pride, and as the 'second cheapest wine theory' tells us, the second-best-selling wine in a restaurant is always the second cheapest on the menu because of the combination of money and face. This difficulty level choice in games is somewhat similar.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    So, someone came up with the concept of dynamic difficulty. The idea is that as players become stronger, the game subtly increases in intensity. Conversely, if a player is consistently losing, the game secretly reduces the difficulty. This way, players are always facing opponents and challenges that match their current skill level. It sounds ideal and perfect, but when players discover this mechanism, everything seems off. Why bother leveling up if, as the player becomes stronger, the enemies also become stronger, rendering the effort meaningless? Imagine a player putting in a lot of effort to defeat a challenging boss and finally succeeding. However, the player doesn't feel happy because they attribute the victory to the boss becoming weaker. This seemingly perfect mechanism, once revealed to players, can lead to various issues.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    So, how to provide players with suitable difficulty and challenges? Jenova Chen discussed Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) in his master's thesis. He proposed a methodology, suggesting to expand the game's immersion zone, essentially making the range of the immersive area larger and widening the flow channel. Then create a player-centric, active dynamic balancing system, allowing players to control it themselves. Alternatively, embedding difficulty options directly into the core gameplay mechanics lets players make choices during the gaming process.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    To illustrate, Jenova Chen developed a game called "Flow," where players take on the role of a floating organism. The main gameplay involves continuously consuming other creatures, and upon consuming a red creature, the game progresses to the next stage. Initially, there are no dangers, but gradually, attacking creatures appear. When players sense danger, they can reduce the difficulty level by consuming blue creatures. The essence of eating red and blue creatures lies in integrating the difficulty selection mechanism with the core gameplay, creating a compelling experience.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    If we visualize this in a chart, the game has existing difficulty levels ranging from easy to hard. The difficulty itself doesn't change automatically; players actively choose based on their preferences. Players, driven by rewards and the desire for strength, need to assess their own capabilities at the moment to decide whether to move on to the next difficulty level. This decision is crucial for obtaining more rewards and becoming stronger. If a player finds the current difficulty too challenging, they can consume blue creatures to revert to the previous difficulty level. This allows continuous training and improvement until the player feels ready to progress again.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    And then going back to the previous discussion on difficulty, I find this aspect truly remarkable. Jenova Chen's reflections are based on the idea that immersion brings joy, and this concept is rooted in the findings of psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. In discussions about game design, what's interesting is that: in this context, theory provides a direction for thinking, and thinking and experimentation crystallize into a philosophy, a methodology. Ultimately, this philosophy and methodology give rise to creative works. Therefore, when discussing game design, there's often no need for arguments. Each person has their own concept, and it's okay to have different interpretations. It's precisely due to these diverse perspectives that we have a multitude of ideas today, and these varied ideas have manifested into a plethora of unique creations.
